    <h1>Activity 01 Task 2</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>My Favourite Movie</b></h1>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Heneral Luna</h1>
    <p>This movie is about the Filipino general know as Heneral Antonio luna, how he fought for the Philippines and died by hands of his fellow Filipino </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Main Character</h2>
    <p><b>Gen. Antonio Luna</b> is the fiery and brilliant commander of the Philippine revolutionary forces during the Philippine-American War. 
        Known for his sharp intellect, military expertise, and fierce patriotism, Luna is both respected and feared by his peers and subordinates.
        His uncompromising stance on discipline and unity often puts him at odds with other leaders, exposing the internal conflicts within the
        revolutionary government. Despite his abrasive demeanor, his genuine love for his country and desire for true independence drive his every action.</p>
    <p><b>Apolinario Mabini</b> Known as the "Brains of the Revolution," Apolinario Mabini serves as the political conscience in the film. 
        Paralyzed from the waist down, his physical limitations contrast with his sharp mind and unwavering principles. Mabini observes the 
        internal struggles with a sense of frustration, highlighting the revolution’s moral and ideological conflicts.</p>
    <p><b>President Emilio Aguinaldo</b> President Emilio Aguinaldo is portrayed as a complex figure, torn between his leadership responsibilities
        and the influence of his close allies. His indecisiveness and political maneuvering contribute to the growing tensions within the 
        revolutionary ranks. Aguinaldo’s character raises questions about loyalty, leadership, and the personal costs of power.</p>
    <p><b>Captain Eduardo Rusca</b> Captain Rusca serves as Luna’s loyal aide-de-camp. He provides both strategic support and emotional grounding for Luna.
        Rusca’s loyalty and pragmatism stand in contrast to Luna’s fiery temper, offering moments of camaraderie amidst the chaos of war.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Plot</h3>
    <h4>The Struggle for Unity</h4>
    <p>The film focuses on Heneral Luna’s relentless efforts to unite the fragmented revolutionary forces against American colonizers. 
        Despite his military brilliance, Luna faces resistance not just from foreign enemies but from within his own ranks. 
        Political rivalries, personal ambitions, and regional loyalties undermine his calls for discipline and national unity.</p>
    <h4>The Rise and Fall</h4>
    <p>As Luna’s influence grows, so do the threats against him. His confrontational leadership style alienates key political figures,
        leading to betrayal and conspiracies. The film builds toward a tragic climax, where Luna’s unwavering ideals clash fatally with
        the harsh realities of politics and power.</p>
    <h4>The Aftermath</h4>
    <p>Luna’s assassination becomes a pivotal moment in the revolution, symbolizing the internal divisions that ultimately weakened the fight for independence. 
        The film ends on a somber note, reflecting on the cost of betrayal and the enduring struggle for true freedom.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Setting</h3>
    <p><b>Revolutionary Battlefields</b>
        The film features gritty, realistic battle scenes that showcase the harsh conditions faced by Filipino soldiers. Trenches, makeshift camps, and war-torn landscapes depict the brutal realities of the Philippine-American War.
        
        <b>Political Halls and Camps</b>
        The contrasting settings of Aguinaldo’s political headquarters and Luna’s military camps emphasize the divide between the government’s political maneuvering and the soldiers’ struggles on the front lines. The opulence of government halls starkly contrasts with the chaos of the battlefield.
        
        <b>Personal Thoughts</b>
        The movie was really great specially for me because i like this kind of setting the story is really engaging and the dialogue is something else 
        really show how fiesty Gen. Luna's personality is and how bad the Philippine government from the very start how it all started why it can' be stopped.
